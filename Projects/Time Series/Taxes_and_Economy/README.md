# Measuring the Impact of Taxes on Economic Growth
---
In some circles, it's a commonly held belief that economic growth increases as the taxation rate goes down. I wish to investigate whether this is actually true. Rather than only performing analysis using taxation against economic growth, I hope to incorporate more signals, such as where the money goes (e.g healthcare, military spending, etc). Based on my prior beliefs, I expect to see that taxes will be less correlated given more fine-grained information.

I will try to incorporate a wide range of techniques, from regression models to time series analysis. Further, I will analyze the results of estimates and perform hypothesis testing to see if my hypothesis is correct.
