# Classical-Statistical-Methods
Educating myself on and implementing a range statistical techniques. 

I hope to learn and implement new inference methods at a rate of around 2 projects or notes/3 days, though this is an ambitious goal. However, given a solid background in probability and statistics (and passing familiarity with some of these methods), I hope to maintain a high rate of productivity.

If there are errors in my notes, I welcome any corrections.

./utils: Contains various utilities written in Python to help me demonstrate examples and code up larger projects. Also helps to keep things separate and readable.
./examples: Contains practical demonstrations of statistical techniques, serving as a counterpart to my notes.
./preliminaries: Contains my typed notes. I will probably need to organize my notes into their own subfolders, as they are currently quite scattered.
